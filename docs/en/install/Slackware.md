## Building Octave on Slackware

GNU Octave is contained in the [SlackBuilds repository](http://www.slackbuilds.org), which contains building receipts for several software packages. The [SlackBuilds Howto](http://slackbuilds.org/howto/) page describes in detail, how to use such a receipt.

The [receipt for Octave](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/academic/octave/) has dependencies, which aren't automatically resolved and are listed in the [README file](https://slackbuilds.org/slackbuilds/15.0/academic/octave/README) of the Octave receipt. Those dependencies are:

+   [BLAS](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/libraries/blas/) and
+   [LAPACK](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/libraries/lapack/)

Note that there are further dependencies which are optional, e.g., [GraphicsMagick](https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/graphics/GraphicsMagick/). Another more general list of dependencies is given in the [Building](Building.html "Building") wiki page.
