# GNU Octave Wiki

[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. The program is named after [Octave Levenspiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave_Levenspiel), a former professor of the principal author. GNU Octave is normally used through its interactive interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)), but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The project was conceived around 1988 and at first it was intended to be a companion to a chemical reactor design course. The GNU Octave language is largely compatible to [Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) so that most programs are easily portable. In addition, functions known from the C standard library and from UNIX system calls and functions are supported. C/C++ and Fortran code can be called from Octave by creating [Oct-Files](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/Getting-Started-with-Oct_002dFiles.html), or using Matlab compatible [Mex-Files](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/Mex_002dFiles.html).
