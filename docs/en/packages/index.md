*This is a list of Packages and Codes available for GNU Octave.*

Octave [packages](https://octave.org/doc/latest/Packages.html) extend the functionality of GNU Octave by particular useful features and can be developed and distributed by anyone. Currently there are two collections of Octave packages:

+   [https://packages.octave.org](https://packages.octave.org)
+   [Octave Forge](Category%253AOctave_Forge.html "Category:Octave Forge") (legacy)

## About Octave packages

The format and requirements of Octave packages is specified in the [GNU Octave manual](https://octave.org/doc/latest/Creating-Packages.html). There is an [example package](https://github.com/gnu-octave/pkg-example) as well.

Octave packages can be installed by the [`pkg`](https://www.octave.org/doc/interpreter/XREFpkg.html) tool. The following two examples demonstrate how to install the [example package](https://github.com/gnu-octave/pkg-example) (1.) after downloading the release tarball and (2.) directly from an URL.

1.  `pkg install pkg-example-1.0.0.tar.gz`
2.  `pkg install [https://github.com/gnu-octave/pkg-example/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/gnu-octave/pkg-example/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz)`

If you created your own package, it can be added to the [Octave Package](https://github.com/gnu-octave/packages/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) index.

Packages listed in the [Octave Packages](https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/) index can be installed with the `-forge` flag, for example:

+   `pkg install -forge image`

The Octave Forge index is a legacy project and does not accept new packages. Existing packages are indexed through [Octave Packages](https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/).

## Free and open-source code with custom installation

Those codes have to be installed as described on the respective website.
